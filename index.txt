About me

I’m a Full Stack Developer and Web Designer from India, focused on creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly web experiences. I enjoy turning ideas into simple and effective designs that work smoothly across devices. Whether it’s front end flow or back end logic, I love building things that feel clear and easy to use
I’ve worked with internships, online clients, and hackathon projects, gaining hands-on experience in real-world development. I add a personal touch to every project and make sure the design matches the brand and message perfectly. My goal is to build websites and apps that look modern, work fast, and give users a great experience.
